## Chat System in Freelancer Dashboard:

I've created a comprehensive chat system for the freelancer dashboard that perfectly integrates with your existing Workbridg platform architecture. The system includes a fully functional FreelancerDashboard page with modular chat components that follow your established design patterns and color scheme.

The chat system features an admin support channel that's always available, plus dynamic project channels that appear once admin approves projects. The interface is mobile-responsive with smooth transitions, and includes realistic mock data to demonstrate the functionality. Users can easily switch between different chat channels, send messages, and see unread message counts - all while maintaining the professional, clean aesthetic that matches your existing pages.

## Dashboard Structure:

 - Sidebar Navigation: Clean navigation with icons for all features (Dashboard, Projects, Messages, Earnings, Analytics, Calendar, Notifications, Profile, Settings)
 - Header: Professional header with search, notifications, and profile dropdown
 - Feature-based Layout: Each feature is a separate component for modularity

 - Feature 3 (Analytics): Performance metrics with views, inquiries, conversion rates, and insights
